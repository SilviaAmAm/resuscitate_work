[dftb_vr.hdf5](./dftb_vr.hdf5): methane reacting with CN sampled in iMD-VR with DFTB.

[dftb_vr_b3lyp.hdf5](./dftb_vr_b3lyp.hdf5): methane reacting with CN sampled in iMD-VR with DFTB. The energies are recalculated at B3LYP level.

[dftb_vr_cc.hdf5](./dftb_vr_cc.hdf5): methane reacting with CN sampled in iMD-VR with DFTB. The energies are recalculated at CCSD(T)-F12b.
